# Algorithms and Data Structures Project

A project designed to test and compare different sorting algorithms. This is part of the coursework and aims to analyze the performance of various sorting methods in different scenarios.


## Project Structure

The program operates in **three main modes**:

### 1. **File-Based Sorting**
- Test each sorting algorithm using values provided in a text file.
- Optionally save the sorted output to a file.

### 2. **Random Data Sorting**
- Test individual algorithms on randomly generated data.
- Customize the test with the following options:
  - **Data Type:** `int`, `float`, or `double`
  - **Array Size:** Specify the size of the dataset
  - **Repetitions:** Number of times to generate and sort data
  - **Initial Data Order:**
    - Fully Random
    - Fully Descending
    - Partially Sorted (Ascending by 33%, 66%, or 100%)
  - **Output File:** Save sorting times for analysis

### 3. **Help Mode**
- Print a help message that shows you how to use the program and its options.


## Implemented Algorithms

The project includes implementations of the following four sorting algorithms:

- **Insert Sort**
- **Binary Insert Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

Each algorithm can be tested across different data sets and configurations to evaluate their performance under various conditions.
